# mini-backends-ai

A collection of small backend-only projects built with Django REST Framework, each exploring a simple AI-powered feature.  
No frontend — all APIs are testable via Postman or Swagger UI.

## Purpose

These apps are part of my preparation for upcoming hackathons.  
The goal is to get faster at moving from idea to production with:

- Clean project structure  
- Clear API design  
- Docker + Swagger setup  
- Fast integration with AI tools (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

## Projects

- **Smart Notes API**  
  Create notes and get AI-generated summaries.

- **Mood Journal**  
  Log journal entries and get sentiment analysis.

- **Resume Reviewer**  
  Upload a resume and receive structured AI feedback.

- **Goal Planner**  
  Set a goal and get a breakdown of tasks.

- **Quote Generator**  
  Get a quote and a motivational AI response.

## Stack

- Django REST Framework  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Swagger (drf-yasg)  
- OpenAI / Gemini API  
- Postman for testing

## Usage

Each app has its own folder with setup instructions.  
Use Docker Compose to run locally.

## Notes

These are practice projects focused on backend planning and execution.  
No UI — just fast, functional, and ready for demo or extension.
